These scripts automate the rendering of dynamically created Javascript websites for the purpose of scraping the sites of their CSS and returning a list of the fonts employed by the sites. The list is returned as a csv file.

This script requires Selenium Python bindings and uses a headless Chrome driver. Bash 5.0 is also required for the enabling of the Bash portions.

MAKE SURE TO USE CHMOD TO MAKE THE BASH SCRIPT AND THE PYTHON SCRIPTS EXECUTABLE IN YOUR MACHINE
